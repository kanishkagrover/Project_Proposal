# Project_Proposal

### **1. CMO PORTAL: (IPOC/BOYD)**

**Usecase :** sharing and exchanging data with Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs) to facilitate collaboration and decision-making.

**Solution :** A web-based application provide a range of functionalities that support:
- Data Entry: Efficient and secure data entry mechanisms
- Data Visualization: Interactive and customizable dashboards for data visualization
- Data Retrieval: Easy and secure data retrieval, download and export options

### **2. ⁠Back-end setup : Web application**

**Usecase :** Design and implement a scalable and secure backend infrastructure to manage patient and doctor data, enable data visualization and analysis, and support multi-tenancy for licensing the product to other companies.

**Solution :** 

App-to-Server Data Transfer

1. App Gateway: The app acts as a gateway, receiving the data from the device and processing it for transmission to the server.
2. API Calls: The app sends the processed data to the server using API calls, ensuring secure and standardized data transfer.

Server-Side Data Management

1. Server Receipt: The server receives the data from the app via API calls.
2. Database Integration: The server pushes the received data into a database, where it is stored and managed.
3. Access Control: The server implements access control mechanisms, ensuring that only authorized users can access and retrieve the data based on their clearance class.

Data Visualization and Clearance-Based Access

1. Data Retrieval: Authorized users can fetch the data from the database according to their clearance class.
2. Data Visualization: The app displays the retrieved data in a visual format, such as charts, graphs, or tables, tailored to the user's clearance class.
3. Clearance-Based Access: The app ensures that users can only access and view data that is authorized for their clearance class, maintaining data confidentiality and security.

### **3. Automating testing**

**Usecase :** Automate FW and SDK testing to reduce manual effort, increase test coverage

**Solution :**  Automate firmware testing processes, including unit testing, sanity checks, regression testing, integration testing, and nightly builds.

### **4. Algorithm development**:

Signal calculation | error and exception handling | complexity and efficiency for Creatinine, Potassium and NT-proBNP

### **5. CAD design and quick dirty prototyping using 3D printing**

### **6. Image processing based defect detection:** 
Manufacturing defects in test strips, error warnings etc → CV2
